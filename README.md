# Airbnb Listing Price Modeling Across Market Tiers

### Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listing data across 12 U.S. cities categorized into three market tiers:
- **Big cities**
- **Medium cities**
- **Small cities**

We build:
- XGBoost regression models
- Multiple Neural Network architectures (Keras MLPs)

Then, we evaluate:
1️⃣ City-level performance  
2️⃣ Tier-level composite performance  
3️⃣ Cross-tier generalization of neural networks
